Håfa Adai yan Tirow Mariånas!



The Marianas Tourism Education Council is challenging all middle and high school students to use their 21st century skills and design an app that will fulfill two purposes for tourism: First, to enhance tourists' understanding of the island community, landscape, hospitality businesses and other service elements that the Northern Mariana Islands is proud to offer. And second, to provide accurate and timely information about the place, people, organizations and services we have to offer as a destination.



Students may compete as individuals or in teams of up to three students. Each participating individual or team shall submit only one app for competition. The deadline to submit is 11:59pm ChST, Feb. 6, 2023. Cash prizes will be awarded to the team leader: 1st place, $500; second place, $300, and third place, $200.

The evaluation criteria include originality of the app idea, creativity of the app design, mobile user experience, and demonstration of indigenous cultures, traditions and/or values. The app should be developed for mobile operating systems (Android OS or iOS) and be installable on a mobile smartphone or tablet device.

The app should have a search function and an island map for navigation, in addition to the functionalities and design elements created by the contestant(s).
